            "For me, to watch Messi play is a pleasure – it’s like having an orgasm 
                – it’s an incredible pleasure. He is always going forwards. He never passes 
                the ball backwards or sideways.
                He has only one idea, to run towards the goal. So as a football fan,
                just enjoy the show."
